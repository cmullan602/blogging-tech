## Description

This is an deployed web application that users can use to login to and share their thoughts about tech. The user of the application can view the homepage that has all of the posts on it but must login to comment on posts as well as post new posts. 

I used sql, node, heroku, handlebars and bulma throughout this project.

I really enjoyed working on this project as it was a culmination of everything we've been working on in class up to this point.
